This Python script performs a substitution encryption on a plaintext using a given key and a set of characters. Here's what each part of the code does:

1. Initialization: 
   - `AllCharacters` contains all the characters that can appear in the plaintext.
   - `key` is the substitution key, indicating the replacement for each character in `AllCharacters`.

2. Reading the Plaintext:
   - It reads the contents of a file named 'plaintext37.txt', storing the plaintext in the variable `plaintext`.

3. Encryption Process:
   - The script iterates through each character in the plaintext.
   - If the character is found in the `AllCharacters` set, it retrieves the corresponding character from the `key` at the same index and appends it to the `ciphertext`.
   - If the character is not found in `AllCharacters`, it appends the character as is to the `ciphertext`. This step ensures that characters not present in the substitution key remain unchanged.

4. Writing the Ciphertext:
   - Finally, the encrypted text stored in `ciphertext` is written to a file named 'ciphertext37.txt'.
